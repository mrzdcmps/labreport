## The LMU Micro-PK Project

This project addresses the relationship between mind and matter and studies observational effects on quantum state reductions. It is located at LMU Munich under the supervision of Prof. Markus Maier and Dr. Moritz Dechamps.

## Micro-Psychokinesis

Micro-Psychokinesis (Micro-Pk) describes a mental influence on inanimate, probabilistic systems, e.g. quantum random number generators (qRNGs), detectable through statistical means [@varvoglis2015micro].

## The Lab Report

This website aims to provide a constantly updated overview of all Micro-Pk experiments conducted at the Maier Lab and their results. This effort is directed to counter biases resulting from selective publication of results [see e.g. @publicat2005].

For each study it will show the main results (differentiating between experimental and control conditions where applicable) and results of the *'change of evidence'* analyses, as well as an overall meta-analytical assessment.

### Included Studies

In this report we include all studies conducted in the LMU Lab exploring a general micro-Pk effect. Not included a precognition experiments.
