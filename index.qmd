## The LMU Micro-PK Project

This project addresses the relationship between mind and matter and studies observational effects on quantum state reductions. It is located at LMU Munich under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Markus Maier](https://www.psy.lmu.de/gp/people/leitung/maier/index.html) and [Dr. Moritz Dechamps](https://www.psy.lmu.de/gp/people/mitarbeiter/moritz-dechamps/index.html).

## Micro-Psychokinesis

The studies conducted in this project use a paradigm called Micro-Psychokinesis (Micro-Pk). Micro-Pk describes a mental influence on inanimate, probabilistic systems, e.g. quantum random number generators (qRNGs), detectable through statistical means [@varvoglis2015micro].

## The Lab Report

This website aims to provide a constantly updated overview of all Micro-Pk experiments conducted at the lab and their results. This effort is directed to counter biases resulting from selective publication of results [see e.g. @publicat2005] and aims for utmost transparency and reproducibility.

For each study it will show the [main results](experiments.html) (differentiating between experimental and control conditions where applicable) and results of the *'[change of evidence](changeofevidence.html)'* analyses, as well as overall meta-analytical assessments of both the [conventional effect](metaanalysis.html) descriptions and the [change of evidence measures](coe-metaanalysis.html).

### Included Studies

In this report we include all studies conducted in the LMU Lab exploring a general Micro-Pk effect. Not included are case studies of individuals or on related psi effects like precognition. Please find detailed information on each study as well as relevant data and resources in the [experiments section](experiments.html).
