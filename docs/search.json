An experimental program written by one of the experimenters in C# accesses the output of the QRNG and depicts a random picture out of two different picture sets depending on the result of the quantum experiment inside the QRNG.\nStimuli\nThe neutral stimulus pictures were taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999), which provides an experimental set of 1169 digitized photographs with normative rating scores (using a 9 point rating scale) on valence and arousal. A set of 10 neutral pictures (valence mean = 4.90; SD = 0.27) were used. The target stimulus pictures were taken from the Geneva Smoking Photographs (GSP) (Khazaal et al., 2012), a normative database providing 60 addiction-relevant photographs for nicotine and tobacco research. Again 10 pictures were chosen showing varying aspects of nicotine products, smoking behavior and tobacco related cues.\nQuantum State Generation\nA quantum based number generator (QRNG) was used to create the quantum experiment. This device creates a quantum state consisting of two eigenstates that correspond to the two possible states of a bit (0/1) that is transferred to the computer. A 0 bit lead to the display of a neutral image while a 1 bit lead to the display of a target stimuli. The QRNG device is connected to the laptop via USB. Since it is not operating with a buffer, it is ensured that the bit that decides which stimulus is shown is generated directly prior to the display of the picture.",

Since there is no physical interaction other than observing, participants were explicitly and repeatedly asked to maintain attention on the pictures for the whole time and to not become distracted. They were told they may interrupt the experiment at any time if they are not feeling well.\nParticipants then were presented with a total of 400 pictures. Each trial started with a fixation cross for 700 msecs followed by the stimulus for 400 msecs and a 400 msecs long inter-trial interval showing only a black screen. Depending on the outcome of the QRNG a random picture was chosen out of the pool of either the neutral stimuli or the tobacco-related target stimuli. Each picture of the two pools had the same probability to be shown in every trial.\nAfter completion of the 400 trials the experimenter prepared the laptop to show a digital questionnaire which asked whether the participant is a smoker or non-smoker. Additionally, with smokers the nicotine dependence was assessed via the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependencies (FTND-G; German version by (John et al., 2003)) as well as the general attitude towards smoking. The experiment and the questionnaire took about 15-20 mins.",

Data was checked separately for each group, smokers and non-smokers, by performing Bayesian one sample t-tests to determine if the mean number of shown target stimuli differs from the expected value (200) in the group of smokers and non-smokers, respectively. We expect the group of smokers to show a different number of smoking-associated pictures than a truly random distribution would suggest while the measured value should not differ from the expected value in the group of non-smokers.\nIf smokers see more or less of the target pictures, a mechanism influencing the selection of the eigenstate that leads to the correspondent picture based on a psychological variable can be assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Data\nDownload Data “Smokers”\nDownload Data “Non-Smokers”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\nOSF Project",

A micro-Pk effect should result in a (temporary; see change of evidence) biasing of the qRNG outcome corresponding to the presentation of more or less of the relevant stimuli.\n\n\nOnline Studies\nIf an experiment is classified as an online study, it was set up with the software jsPsych (Leeuw et al., 2023) and running on a dedicated web server in the departments IT infrastructure. A qRNG is directly connected to the web server via USB and provides random events without a buffer.\n\n\nProcedural Details\nPlease refer to the experimental programs attached to the resources of each study for all procedural details, like stimulus presentation timings, questionnaires, etc.",

    "text": "Research Questions\nWe expect that a high state of incongruence of the psychological basic needs tends to express itself through micro-PK-effects. According to (Grawe, 1998) the four basic psychological needs are attachment, self-esteem enhancement/protection, orientation and control and pleasure maximisation and disstress avoidance. These needs can be satisfied through goals of approach or avoidance. We therefore conduct an experiment that relates the needs for attachment, self-esteem protection and orientation and control to the output of a true random number generator (tRNG). We exclude the need for pleasure maximisation and disstress avoidance because it could not be operationalized concretly enough in our study. We designed the need for attachment as approach orientated and the needs for self-esteem protection and orientation and control as avoidance orientated to gain a deeper understanding of the differences between these motivational strategies.\nIn contrast to most previous research on the influence of participants on RNGs, we focus on the effect of unconscious motivational patterns instead of conscious attempts to manipulate the RNG (see also (Maier & Dechamps, 2018)). According to “Generalized Quantum Theory” (Filk & Römer, 2010) quantum-phenomena can occur on a macroscopic level within complex systems like conscious human individuals. We therefore use a quantum based RNG in our experiment. Depending on the outcome of the tRNG a need-focused or a neutral stimulus is presented to the participant. We hypothesize that the participant´s observation in combination with the corresponding emotional reaction causes quantum-entanglement between the individual and a reality that either fulfills or frustrates their basic needs. Because deprived needs tend to cause high emotional activation if they are ignored in general, they are more likely to express themselves in micro-PK-effects. This study therefore aims to explore the differences in micro-PK effects between high- and low-incongruence participants on corresponding stimuli.\nHypotheses\n\nHigh-incongruence of needs and micro-PK\n\n\n\nAttachment Individuals with a high incongruence of the need for attachment are expected to show a deviation from randomness when presented pictures addressing this need. Since the target stimuli are designed to resemble an approach motivated way of satisfying the need, we hypothesize that high-incongruence participants, i.e. participants who are generally unable to satisfy this need adequately, show less target stimuli (attachment) than chance suggests.\nSelf-esteem Since the target stimuli are designed to resemble an avoidance motivated way of satisfying the need, we hypothesize that high-incongruence participants, i.e. participants who are generally unable to avoid self-worth reducing stimuli adequately, show more target stimuli (self-esteem) than chance suggests.\nControl We hypothesize that high-incongruence (need for orientation and control) participants, i.e. participants who are generally unable to exert control sufficiently, experience more trials with no opportunity to end the display of the stimulus (non-control trials) than chance suggests.\n\n\n\nLow-incongruence of need and micro-PK\n\nWe expect low-incongruence participants to show no deviation from chance. Since the need for attachment is a growth-orientated need (i.e. this need can never be oversaturated) low-incongruence participants might also show a less strong deviation in the same direction as the high-incongruence group.\nIn contrast both avoidance orientated needs - the need for self-esteem protection and the need for orientation and control - are deficiency-orientated (i.e. constant frustration of this need leads to psychological distress) . We therefore expect the low-incongruence participants to show no deviation or a less strong deviation in the opposite direction as the high-incongruence group, because they might be able to avoid negative experiences even more so.\nBecause of the specific features of micro-PK only small effects (d ≤ .2) turn out to be reliable in research practice (Lucado & Romer, 2007), for which reason we predict low deviations from a random distribution.",

    "text": "Research Questions\nWe expect that a high state of incongruence of the psychological basic needs tends to express itself through micro-PK-effects. According to (Grawe, 1998) the four basic psychological needs are attachment, self-esteem enhancement/protection, orientation and control and pleasure maximisation and disstress avoidance. These needs can be satisfied through goals of approach or avoidance. We therefore conduct an experiment that relates the needs for attachment, self-esteem protection and orientation and control to the output of a true random number generator (tRNG). We exclude the need for pleasure maximisation and disstress avoidance because it could not be operationalized concretly enough in our study. We designed the need for attachment as approach orientated and the needs for self-esteem protection and orientation and control as avoidance orientated to gain a deeper understanding of the differences between these motivational strategies.\nIn contrast to most previous research on the influence of participants on RNGs, we focus on the effect of unconscious motivational patterns instead of conscious attempts to manipulate the RNG (see also (Maier & Dechamps, 2018)). According to “Generalized Quantum Theory” (Filk & Römer, 2010) quantum-phenomena can occur on a macroscopic level within complex systems like conscious human individuals. We therefore use a quantum based RNG in our experiment. Depending on the outcome of the tRNG a need-focused or a neutral stimulus is presented to the participant. We hypothesize that the participant´s observation in combination with the corresponding emotional reaction causes quantum-entanglement between the individual and a reality that either fulfills or frustrates their basic needs. Because deprived needs tend to cause high emotional activation if they are ignored in general, they are more likely to express themselves in micro-PK-effects. This study therefore aims to explore the differences in micro-PK effects between high- and low-incongruence participants on corresponding stimuli.\nHypotheses\n\nHigh-incongruence of needs and micro-PK\n\n\n\nAttachment Individuals with a high incongruence of the need for attachment are expected to show a deviation from randomness when presented pictures addressing this need. Since the target stimuli are designed to resemble an approach motivated way of satisfying the need, we hypothesize that high-incongruence participants, i.e. participants who are generally unable to satisfy this need adequately, show less target stimuli (attachment) than chance suggests.\nSelf-esteem Since the target stimuli are designed to resemble an avoidance motivated way of satisfying the need, we hypothesize that high-incongruence participants, i.e. participants who are generally unable to avoid self-worth reducing stimuli adequately, show more target stimuli (self-esteem) than chance suggests.\nControl We hypothesize that high-incongruence (need for orientation and control) participants, i.e. participants who are generally unable to exert control sufficiently, experience more trials with no opportunity to end the display of the stimulus (non-control trials) than chance suggests.\n\n\n\nLow-incongruence of need and micro-PK\n\nWe expect low-incongruence participants to show no deviation from chance. Since the need for attachment is a growth-orientated need (i.e. this need can never be oversaturated) low-incongruence participants might also show a less strong deviation in the same direction as the high-incongruence group.\nIn contrast both avoidance orientated needs - the need for self-esteem protection and the need for orientation and control - are deficiency-orientated (i.e. constant frustration of this need leads to psychological distress) . We therefore expect the low-incongruence participants to show no deviation or a less strong deviation in the opposite direction as the high-incongruence group, because they might be able to avoid negative experiences even more so.\nBecause of the specific features of micro-PK only small effects (d ≤ .2) turn out to be reliable in research practice (Lucado & Romer, 2007), for which reason we predict low deviations from a random distribution.",

    "text": "Materials\nThis was an online study.\nStudy design\nIn this study a between subjects design is used. Participants will be divided into two groups (low-incongruence vs. high-incongruence) based on their average overall-incongruence in the psychological needs measured by the “Inkongruenzfragebogen (INK)” (Grosse Holtforth et al., 2004). The dividing point will be the standardized average value for healthy individuals given in the manual.\nMeasured variables\n\nAttachment: Target stimuli contain 20 pictures of happy couples. These are designed to address the need for attachment within the partipants. The pictures are obtained from Shutterstock (www.shutterstock.com), a provider of royalty-free stock photos. Neutral stimuli are obtained from OASIS (Kurdi et al., 2016), a picture set containing 900 validated stimuli. 20 pictures depicting everyday objects and rated very low on arousal and with neutral valence are selected.\nSelf-esteem: Target stimuli contain words phrased in a way to challenge the need for self-esteem protection in participants. These are generally negatively perceived adjectives that address physical appearance (e.g. “ugly”), sense of self-worth (e.g. “worthless”), and academic skills (e.g. “stupid”). These categories correspond to the self-esteem-related dimensions in the “Feelings of Inadequacy Scale” (Janis & Field, 1959). Neutral stimuli contain adjectives that are not typically used to describe persons and therefore don’t possess a quality towards self-esteem. We re using adjectives describing geometric figures and surface textures (e.g. “five-cornered”, “dotted”).\n\nThe outcome variables regarding the need for attachment and self-esteem protection will be the number of displayed target stimuli.\n\nControl: To test the need for orientation and control participants are presented displeasant, nauseating pictures. The pictures are taken out of the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999) and are rated with a comparatively negative valence and high arousal. The display of the pictures either can be ended as soon as it is displayed by pressing a button (control trial) or takes 2500 ms regardless of a button being pressed or not (non-control-trial). To create a feeling of “loss of control” we choose a percentage of 75% trials, in which it is possible to exert control over the presentation time.\n\nThe outcome variable regarding the need for control will be the number of trials where pressing a button will not end the display (non-control-trial).",

The entire experiment took approximately 30 minutes. The experimenter read a standardized text explaining the procedure in a friendly but factual manner. If the participants had no further questions, the experimenter gave the signal to start the INK. After answering all questions, participants were instructed to continue by clicking the “Next” button and to start the image display by pressing any button when ready. Participants attended attentively to three consecutive series of ten trials each. The micro-PK tasks were administered in the following order: “attachment”, “self-esteem protection”, and “loss of control”. After each task, the program asked the subjects to focus and press the button again to confirm their attention. On each trial, they first looked at a fixation cue (700 msec), then at the stimulus (pictures: 400 msec; words: 800 msec), and finally at a black screen (interstimulus interval: 400 msec). This procedure was repeated a total of 30 times. In each sequence, the QRNG decided whether the next image shown would be from a set of need-related or neutral images. BitBabbler’s randomization function selected which of the stimuli from the selected set would be shown. At the beginning of each trial, the QRNG selected a number corresponding to one of the 20 stimuli from both sets. After the fixation cue, the sequence generated by the QRNG was completed to select the final stimulus by determining the category. Stimuli were selected by means of substitution sampling.\nAfter completing the third task, participants were asked to complete the post-task questionnaire, in which they were asked to indicate how unpleasant they found the disgusting pictures (from 1 = “very unpleasant” to 5 = “not at all unpleasant”) and to state their assumptions about the aim of the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Data\nDownload Data “High”\nDownload Data “Low”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\nPreregistration\nOSF Project",

A set of 10 neutral pictures (valence mean = 4.90; SD = 0.27) were used. The target stimulus pictures were taken from the Geneva Smoking Photographs (GSP) (Khazaal et al., 2012), a normative database providing 60 addiction-relevant photographs for nicotine and tobacco research. Again 10 pictures were chosen showing varying aspects of nicotine products, smoking behavior and tobacco related cues.\nQuantum State Generation\nA quantum based number generator (QRNG) was used to create the quantum experiment. This device creates a quantum state consisting of two eigenstates that correspond to the two possible states of a bit (0/1) that is transferred to the computer. A 0 bit lead to the display of a neutral image while a 1 bit lead to the display of a target stimuli. The QRNG device is connected to the laptop via USB.

They were told they may interrupt the experiment at any time if they are not feeling well.\nParticipants then were presented with a total of 400 pictures. Each trial started with a fixation cross for 700 msecs followed by the stimulus for 400 msecs and a 400 msecs long inter-trial interval showing only a black screen.

Each picture of the two pools had the same probability to be shown in every trial.\nAfter completion of the 400 trials the experimenter prepared the laptop to show a digital questionnaire which asked whether the participant is a smoker or non-smoker. Additionally, with smokers the nicotine dependence was assessed via the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependencies (FTND-G; German version by (John et al., 2003)) as well as the general attitude towards smoking.
