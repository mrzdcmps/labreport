In spiritual acoustics the f-key corresponds with the frequency of the heart chakra, which according to yogic teaching is responsible for the experience and processing of love and kindness and related emotions. The chanted “Yam”-sound is one of the seven Bija-mantras and is attributed to the heart-chakra as well."

A micro-Pk effect should result in a (temporary; see change of evidence) biasing of the qRNG outcome corresponding to the presentation of more or less of the relevant stimuli.\n\n\nOnline Studies\nIf an experiment is classified as an online study, it was set up with the software jsPsych (Leeuw et al., 2023) and running on a dedicated web server in the departments IT infrastructure. A qRNG is directly connected to the web server via USB and provides random events without a buffer.\n\n\nProcedural Details\nPlease refer to the experimental programs attached to the resources of each study for all procedural details, like stimulus presentation timings, questionnaires, etc."

This effort is directed to counter biases resulting from selective publication of results (see e.g. Rothstein et al., 2005).\nFor each study it will show the main results (differentiating between experimental and control conditions where applicable) and results of the ‘change of evidence’ analyses, as well as an overall meta-analytical assessment.\n\nIncluded Studies\nIn this report we include all studies conducted in the LMU Lab exploring a general micro-Pk effect. Not included are experiments of individuals or on related psi effects like precognition."
