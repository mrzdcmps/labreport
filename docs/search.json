An experimental program written by one of the experimenters in C# accesses the output of the QRNG and depicts a random picture out of two different picture sets depending on the result of the quantum experiment inside the QRNG.\nStimuli\nThe neutral stimulus pictures were taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999), which provides an experimental set of 1169 digitized photographs with normative rating scores (using a 9 point rating scale) on valence and arousal. A set of 10 neutral pictures (valence mean = 4.90; SD = 0.27) were used. The target stimulus pictures were taken from the Geneva Smoking Photographs (GSP) (Khazaal et al., 2012), a normative database providing 60 addiction-relevant photographs for nicotine and tobacco research. Again 10 pictures were chosen showing varying aspects of nicotine products, smoking behavior and tobacco related cues.\nQuantum State Generation\nA quantum based number generator (QRNG) was used to create the quantum experiment. This device creates a quantum state consisting of two eigenstates that correspond to the two possible states of a bit (0/1) that is transferred to the computer. A 0 bit lead to the display of a neutral image while a 1 bit lead to the display of a target stimuli. The QRNG device is connected to the laptop via USB. Since it is not operating with a buffer, it is ensured that the bit that decides which stimulus is shown is generated directly prior to the display of the picture.",

Since there is no physical interaction other than observing, participants were explicitly and repeatedly asked to maintain attention on the pictures for the whole time and to not become distracted. They were told they may interrupt the experiment at any time if they are not feeling well.\nParticipants then were presented with a total of 400 pictures. Each trial started with a fixation cross for 700 msecs followed by the stimulus for 400 msecs and a 400 msecs long inter-trial interval showing only a black screen. Depending on the outcome of the QRNG a random picture was chosen out of the pool of either the neutral stimuli or the tobacco-related target stimuli. Each picture of the two pools had the same probability to be shown in every trial.\nAfter completion of the 400 trials the experimenter prepared the laptop to show a digital questionnaire which asked whether the participant is a smoker or non-smoker. Additionally, with smokers the nicotine dependence was assessed via the Fagerstr√∂m Test for Nicotine Dependencies (FTND-G; German version by (John et al., 2003)) as well as the general attitude towards smoking. The experiment and the questionnaire took about 15-20 mins.",

It includes ten items per PT, rated on a four-point scale, and has good internal consistency (Œ± = .72 to Œ± = .86) and retest reliability (r = .70 to r = .83). Scores were divided into high scorers (target group) and low scorers (control group) based on a mean cut-off (‚â• 1.00).\nStimuli\nFor each PT, five target stimuli were created based on VDS-30 items, aimed at triggering doubts in individuals with respective PTs. Five neutral control sentences were also selected. An online pre-study rated these sentences on valence, correlating ratings with VDS-30 scores. Initial data collection involved 73 participants rating 60 sentences in randomized order, with filler sentences to avoid negative mood shifts. Adequate trait-specific correlations were found for DE-PT and AV-PT targets, with additional sentences created as needed.

The experimental program was executed on a dedicated webserver based at the university and displayed via participants‚Äô web browsers, implemented using jsPsych, a JavaScript library designed for online behavioral experiments.\nStimuli: Positive and negative pictures served as target stimuli, with a mixture of these as prime stimuli. The target stimuli were sourced from Shutterstock and included 20 positive photographs (depicting pets, peaceful landscapes, and happy people) and 20 negative photographs (depicting dangerous or attacking animals and other negative scenarios). These images were selected based on valence estimations by two experts in experimental emotion induction techniques. Each positive image was paired with a similar negative image to create matched pairs (e.g., a friendly dog vs.¬†an aggressive dog). To balance color differences, all images were converted to black-and-white.\nTwo classes of priming stimuli were created: neutral (control) and positive (experimental). Neutral primes were constructed by overlaying two matched target pictures (50/50 blend), resulting in 20 neutral primes. These primes were accompanied by forward and backward masks, created by scrambling the prime image into blocks to destroy meaningful content. Positive priming involved the same matched target pairs, but with a progressive increase in the positive image share (50/50, then 60/40, then 70/30) to make the positive picture more dominant in the participant‚Äôs unconscious mind.\nPriming Procedure: Each trial included presenting a subliminal prime followed by a target picture. Each priming stimulus was shown three times before the target display, and the target picture was randomly selected by a quantum random number generator (qRNG) from the pair used to create the prime. The assignment of neutral or positive priming to a trial was performed by a pseudo-random number generator (pRNG).\nThis experimental setup aimed to test the influence of unconscious priming on participants‚Äô perception of positive or negative stimuli, examining how the priming affected the likelihood of selecting positive or negative target images.",

They were informed that they would see flickering visual stimuli and positive and negative images, which they should watch passively. Participants could abort the experiment at any time.\nEach participant completed 40 trials. Half of the 20 matched target pairs were randomly assigned to the positive priming condition and the other half to the neutral priming condition. Each pair was used twice, resulting in 40 trials. A pseudo-RNG determined the order of these trials. In each trial, a fixation cross was shown first, followed by the priming sequence. In the neutral priming condition, a 50/50 mixture prime was shown three times for 55 ms each, with forward and backward masks. In the positive priming condition, the primes varied between a 50/50, 60/40, and 70/30 mixture. After the priming sequence, a qRNG determined whether the positive or negative target stimulus would be displayed for 1000 ms. Each trial ended with a 1200 ms black inter-trial interval before the next trial began. The dependent variables were the mean number of positive pictures and the number of 0 bits generated by the qRNG in both priming conditions.\nAfter the task, participants completed a questionnaire assessing stimulus-seeking behavior, self-efficacy attitude related to general life outcomes, and generalized optimism and pessimism using the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R). These measures were exploratory, with no specific hypotheses, and results will be reported in a future publication.",

The stopping rule was defined as a Bayes Factor (BF) of 10, indicating strong evidence for either the null hypothesis (H0) or the alternative hypothesis (H1). For the analyses in Study 1, an uninformed prior following a Cauchy distribution centered around 0 with an r = 0.1 was chosen, based on an estimated effect size of Cohen‚Äôs d = 0.1, which has been previously applied in similar research. The prediction was that there would be more positive stimuli than expected by chance in the experimental condition, with a smaller effect in the control condition. Two separate one-sample Bayesian t-tests with a one-tailed approach were used for the analyses, performed regularly (almost weekly) with updated sample means. The statistical software JASP (Version 0.9) was used for these analyses. Data collection occurred from March to July 2018.\nAlthough the stopping criterion of BF10 = 10 was reached multiple times during data collection, it went unnoticed due to the large volume of data points added weekly. As a result, data collection continued until the criterion was securely met, which occurred at N = 4,092 participants. Demographic data were available for 4,034 participants.

The neutral and heterosexual erotic images were sourced from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), while the lesbian and gay erotic images were obtained from license-free websites and validated by individuals of each sexual orientation to ensure appropriateness and normative quality.muli, examining how the priming affected the likelihood of selecting positive or negative target images.",

The sample included adults aged 18 and older, recruited through various channels such as social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and university contacts. The link to the study was shared in diverse groups, including those focused on psychological topics, as well as groups related to different sexual orientations.\nParticipants first answered demographic questions and completed part of the Cyber Pornography Use Inventory (CPUI) to assess their addiction to internet pornography. They also responded to questions about their pornography consumption habits and general attitudes toward pornography. Following this, participants were shown 50 images that matched their sexual orientation, which included either erotic content or neutral stimuli like everyday objects. After viewing the images, participants answered post-task questions to assess how seriously they had taken the study and the truthfulness of their responses. These answers were used to exclude any participants who might have provided dishonest or inattentive responses, ensuring the validity of the study‚Äôs findings. Finally, two questions related to self-efficacy were included, although they were not central to the research question and were intended for use in a different study.",

Additionally, the report offers meta-analytical assessments of both conventional effect measures and change of evidence measures alongside a discussion of the results.\n\nIncluded Studies\nThis report includes all studies conducted at the LMU Lab that explore a general and universal Micro-PK effect. Excluded are case studies of individuals or studies on related psi effects such as precognition. Some studies included followed modified hypotheses and/or experimental designs. To compare and aggregate the studies for this report, we assumed one-tailed hypotheses (with the exception of the Smokers 1 study) and single-group designs tested with one-sample t-tests against the mean expected by chance. Experimental and control conditions are therefor viewed as separate studies.\nDetailed information on the original hypotheses and design of each study, along with relevant data and resources, can be found in the experiments section.\n\n\nVersions\nThe report is regularly updated to include new studies and results. The current second version includes all studies conducted from the beginning of the project in 2016 until 13 July 2025.\n\n\nComments and Feedback\nInstead of a traditional peer-review process, we would like to encourage you to provide feedback on the report using the hypothesis.is platform, which can be activated by opening the sidebar on the right. This way, we hope to foster a more open and transparent dialogue about the results and methods presented here."

Although individual studies included in this report often tested specific hypotheses, the meta-analysis focused on a general micro-PK effect to ensure comparability. Descriptions of the hypotheses for each study can be found in the respective experiments section.\nThe overall effect size for micro-PK was found to be non-significant (0.008, p = 0.394) across experimental conditions, with moderate heterogeneity (41.29%). Similarly, control conditions showed no significant effect (-0.009, p = 0.211). These results suggest that the experimental manipulations may not be robust enough to produce a consistently meaningful effect. The moderate heterogeneity in both analyses indicates variability due to study design or implementation differences, though the lack of significant heterogeneity in control conditions suggests that variability in experimental conditions is more likely due to differences in interventions.",

    "text": "Change of Evidence Measures\nSince Psi-effects may be influenced by the accumulation of evidence over time, new measures have been devised to analyze how this evidence changes. By comparing these results to simulations, empirical p-values can be calculated. A meta-analytic assessment of these change-of-evidence measures was conducted using the inverse chi-square invchisq-function to combine p-values across studies. Three characteristics were analyzed: Maximum Bayes Factor (BF), BF Energy, and the amplitude sum of the BF curve‚Äôs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\nFor all experimental conditions, the combined chi-square statistics were calculated with 35571 degrees of freedom, yielding the following results: 36155.12 for the Maximum BF (p = 0.015), 36096.14 for the BF Energy (p = 0.025) and 36174.83 for the FFT amplitude sum (p = 0.012).\nThe analysis of change of evidence measures demonstrated statistically significant results for experimental conditions, suggesting that observed evidence changes are unlikely due to random variation. This could be the result of a volatile micro-PK effect. The tests are robust to using methods that do or do not account for varying sample sizes, thus addressing potential issues of overweighting studies that show a noticeable BF early on and whose data collection is extended.\nIn contrast, none of the three characteristics demonstrated statistically significant results for the control conditions. However, these significant results in experimental conditions do not necessarily translate into a substantial overall effect, as no significant effect was found in the aggregate meta-analysis of micro-PK interventions. They do, however, indicate that the observed changes in evidence are not likely due to random variation.",

Future research should focus on refining experimental designs, conducting replication studies, and maintaining transparent reporting practices to further explore and validate micro-PK effects. Addressing these aspects will help in understanding the underlying mechanisms and improving the robustness of evidence in this field.\nWe would like to additionally encourage the scientific community to follow this example of transparent reporting and data sharing to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of research findings in the field of parapsychology and related disciplines and to counteract publication bias and selective reporting practices.",

    "text": "Empirical research on Micro-Pk often times reports a decline of initially present effects (Colborn, 2018). This phenomenon can be explained either by an initial false positive followed naturally by a regression to the true mean. Alternatively, it fits the predictions of the Model of Pragmatic Information, which states that novel, autonomous effects are inversely linked to their confirmation or detectability (Lucadou et al., 2007). This would result in a decrease of effect size over time, since accumulated data means more power and possibility of convincing confirmatory results (Maier et al., 2022).\nRecently, efforts have been made to find ways to methodically distinguish false positives from decline effects using so called change of evidence-measures (Dechamps, 2019). These measures work by analyzing the temporal development of Bayesian evidence for the effect over the course of data collection and compare certain characteristics to a set of simulations representing possible an empirical null distribution.",

    "text": "Bayesian Analysis\nIn Bayesian statistics, test results often times are reported as Bayes Factors (BF). A BF characterizes the relative evidence for two hypotheses, e.g.¬†the presence of an effect versus the absence of an effect. A BF of 1 indicates equal evidence for both hypotheses, a BF &gt; 1 indicates evidence for the presence of an effect (H1), and a BF &lt; 1 indicates evidence for the absence of an effect (H0). A BF is symmetrical around 1, meaning that a BF of 0.5 indicates the same evidence for H0 as a BF of 2 indicates for H1. Similar to the convetion of using a p-value of 0.05 as a threshold for significance, a BF can be classified into different categories of evidence strength, whereas a BF &gt; 3 is considered moderate evidence, and a BF &gt; 10 is considered strong evidence (Jeffreys, 1961)\n\\[ BF = \\frac{P(D|H1)}{P(D|H0)} \\]\nAn advantage of Bayesian testing is that it allows for the continuous updating of evidence as new data comes in. In contrast to using p-values, there is no need for an a priori power analysis. Instead a desired level of evidence can be set, and the data collection can be stopped as soon as this level is reached. Even then, data can be added to further substantiate the evidence without the risk of inflating error rates, since the BF is consistent over time.\nThe possibility of monitoring the change of evidence over time is especially useful in the context of Micro-Pk research, where an effect volatility could be assumed. If this was the case, the BF would not be consistent, but dependent on the level of confirmatory power. This would result in unusual patterns of evidence change, which could be detected by comparing the empirical BF to a set of simulated BFs as is done with the following change of evidence-measures.",

The empirical BF is then compared to this distribution to detect unusual patterns of evidence change.\nThe simulations used for the analysis of this lab report are generated with true random numbers using the same qRNG as most of the studies. This ensures that the simulations are based on the same random process as the empirical data. The number of simulations is set to 1000, which is a common number in the literature.",

The energy of the BF is a measure of the overall evidence for the presence of an effect at any point in time.\nExample:\n\nplotbf(bf)+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(x=1:length(bf$BF), ymin = pmin(bf$BF, 1), ymax = 1), fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(x=1:length(bf$BF), ymin = 1, ymax = pmax(bf$BF, 1)), fill = \"green\", alpha = 0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: The green area indicates the positive energy (bf directed towards H1), the red area the negative energy (bf directed towards H0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nres &lt;- energybf(bf, sims)\nprint(res)\n\nChange of Evidence Results \nNumber of Simulations:  1000 \nEnergy of Bayes Factor (BF):  564.2794 \nSimulations' Energy: M =  -19.24502 , SD =  224.5401 \nSimulations with this or higher Energy:  1.9 %\n\n\n\n\nFrequency Analysis\nThe Frequency Analysis provides a measure of the pronouncedness of oscillatory patterns in the BF curve. If an effect is countered by a decline effect the BF curve will oscillate between and increase and decrease of evidence. This measure is calculated by specifying the Fast Fourier transforms of the experimental and simulated BF curves and adding up all amplitude values. A sampling rate of 1 over the number of data points is used and only the first half of the fft is considered, since it is symmetrical.\nExample:\n\nplotfft(fftcreate(bf), sims)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: The Fast Fourier Transform of the Bayes Factor curve.

Since we don‚Äôt have effect sizes for these measures, we will combine the empirical p-values of the studies, this means, we will analyze the amount of simulations that show an equal or higher value in the maxbf, energybf, and frequency tests than the empirical BF.\nThe resulting p-values will be analyzed using the inverse chi-square method, which converts each p-value into a chi-square statistic and then sums them up. The method allows for the incorporation of different degrees of freedom, making it particularly useful when the p-values come from tests with varying sample sizes.\n\nExperimental StudiesControl Studies\n\n\nIn this analysis all Micro-Pk studies of the LMU Micro-Pk Lab are included that hypothesize the presence of an effect.

A micro-Pk effect should result in a (temporary; see change of evidence) biasing of the qRNG outcome corresponding to the presentation of more or less of the relevant stimuli.\n\n\nOnline Studies\nIf an experiment is classified as an online study, it was set up with the software jsPsych (Leeuw et al., 2023) and running on a dedicated web server in the departments IT infrastructure. A qRNG is directly connected to the web server via USB and provides random events without a buffer.\n\n\nProcedural Details\nPlease refer to the experimental programs attached to the resources of each study for all procedural details, like stimulus presentation timings, questionnaires, etc.",

    "text": "Hypothesis\nThe research hypotheses of the study focus on testing the validity of a micropsychokinetic (micro-PK) effect, which refers to the idea that the mind can subconsciously influence random events, such as the viewing of erotic images. The study builds on previous work by Maier and Dechamps, who suggested that a micro-PK effect might manifest as a decrease in effect strength over time, following a pattern similar to a damped harmonic oscillation (a gradually diminishing wave-like pattern). The hypotheses are as follows:\n\nThe micro-PK effect will decrease over time during data collection.\nThe micro-PK effect will follow a systematic pattern similar to a damped harmonic oscillation, which would require a large sample size to observe.\nIf a micro-PK effect is present, the frequency of increases and decreases in the effect will be higher when analyzed sequentially compared to simulated data, indicating a true micro-PK effect.\n\nThe experiment focuses on the influence of micro-PK effects triggered by the unconscious desires of individuals addicted to pornography when viewing erotic images. The study assumes that the unconscious need for explicit material (independent variable) might influence the results of a true random number generator (tRNG), leading to a higher probability of selecting images that match the observer‚Äôs unconscious needs.\nFinally, the study predicts that for pornography addicts, the tRNG will generate fewer erotic images than expected by chance, forming the basis for applying the previous three hypotheses:\n\nWhen observed by a subject addicted to pornography, the number of erotic images shown will be statistically significantly below the chance level.",

Internet pornography addiction was assessed using the Cyber-Pornography Use Inventory (CPUI), which includes items on perceived compulsivity, isolation, effort to access pornography, and guilt. Attitudes towards pornography were measured using a nine-item scale, and participants‚Äô pornography usage behavior was also recorded. Control variables included honesty, attention to the images, and how erotic the images were perceived to be.\nThe experimental phase involved participants viewing a series of 50 randomly generated images, either erotic or neutral, determined by a quantum random number generator. The experiment was conducted online, with participants instructed to focus on the images while maintaining attention throughout. The images were displayed briefly, followed by a black screen, and this process was repeated 50 times. The study aimed to measure the number of erotic images viewed as the dependent variable.\nThe stimuli used in the experiment included neutral images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and erotic images from both IAPS and the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS). Due to a lack of suitable erotic images, particularly homosexual ones, additional images were sourced from license-free databases and validated by experts. Participants could choose image sets based on their sexual orientation, ensuring that the erotic content was relevant to their preferences.",

    "text": "Sample Size and Data Analysis\nThe statistical analysis in the study followed the approach of previous studies conducted by the lab utilizing Bayesian inference techniques. Before conducting the study, it was decided to use Bayesian one-sided one-sample t-tests for data analysis.\nFor the Bayesian analysis, the effect size was defined a priori using a Cauchy distribution, with a scale parameter (r) of .1, based on previous research by the LMU Micro-Pk lab. This choice of a lower r value is typical in psi research, where effect sizes are generally small.\nTo determine if the effect followed a damped harmonic oscillation, a regression analysis was conducted using the Python module SciPy. Specifically, the scipy.optimize.curve_fit function was employed, which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to estimate the parameters of the damped harmonic oscillation based on the principle of the sum of least squares. This method allowed the researchers to assess whether the data exhibited the predicted oscillatory pattern.\nThe sample size was determined by practical restrictions, since this study was conducted as a student project with limited resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Report\nExperimental Program\nQuestionnaire\nStimuli Sources",

The need for pleasure maximization and distress avoidance was excluded due to operationalization challenges. The study hypothesizes that unconscious motivational patterns influence the outcomes of a true random number generator (tRNG), rather than conscious attempts to manipulate it.\nHypotheses\n\nHigh-Incongruence of Needs and Micro-PK\n\n\n\nAttachment: Participants with high incongruence in the need for attachment are expected to show fewer attachment-related target stimuli than chance suggests.\nSelf-Esteem: High-incongruence participants for self-esteem protection will show more self-esteem-related target stimuli than chance.\nControl: Those with high incongruence in orientation and control will experience more non-control trials than chance.\n\n\n\nLow-Incongruence of Needs and Micro-PK\n\n\n\nGeneral: Low-incongruence participants are expected to show no deviation from chance.\nAttachment: Since attachment is growth-oriented, low-incongruence participants might show a less strong deviation in the same direction as high-incongruence participants.\nSelf-Esteem and Control: As these needs are deficiency-oriented, low-incongruence participants might show no deviation or a less strong deviation in the opposite direction compared to high-incongruence participants.",

Participants were divided into two groups (low-incongruence vs.¬†high-incongruence) based on their scores on the ‚ÄúInkongruenzfragebogen (INK)‚Äù (Grosse Holtforth et al., 2004). The division point was the standardized average value for healthy individuals as specified in the manual.\nMeasured variables\n\nAttachment: Target stimuli consisted of 20 pictures of happy couples, sourced from Shutterstock, aimed at addressing the need for attachment. Neutral stimuli, sourced from the OASIS picture set (Kurdi et al., 2016), included 20 pictures of everyday objects rated low on arousal and neutral in valence. The outcome variable for attachment was the number of displayed target stimuli.\nSelf-esteem: The target stimuli included negatively perceived adjectives that challenge self-esteem (e.g., ‚Äúugly,‚Äù ‚Äúworthless,‚Äù ‚Äústupid‚Äù), corresponding to dimensions in the ‚ÄúFeelings of Inadequacy Scale‚Äù (Janis & Field, 1959). Neutral stimuli included adjectives describing geometric figures and surface textures (e.g., ‚Äúfive-cornered,‚Äù ‚Äúdotted‚Äù). The outcome variable for self-esteem was the number of displayed target stimuli.\nControl: To test the need for orientation and control, participants were shown unpleasant pictures from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999), which have a negative valence and high arousal. In control trials, participants could end the display by pressing a button, whereas in non-control trials, the display lasted 2500 ms regardless of button press. 75% of the trials allowed for control over the presentation time. The outcome variable for control was the number of non-control trials.",

Participants viewed a fixation cue for 700 ms, then a stimulus (pictures for 400 ms; words for 800 ms), followed by a black screen for 400 ms.\nFor each trial, a quantum random number generator (QRNG) determined whether the stimulus would be need-related or neutral, and BitBabbler‚Äôs randomization function selected the specific stimulus from the chosen set. The QRNG‚Äôs randomization ensured that the selected stimulus was either from a need-related set or a neutral set.\nAfter the third task, participants completed a post-task questionnaire.

A pseudo-RNG determined the trial order and conditions, with trials randomly assigned to positive or neutral priming conditions. Each participant experienced 40 trials, with stimulus sets selected from 14 available sets via sampling with replacement.\nThe procedure for each trial involved displaying a fixation cross (1200 ms), a forward mask (160 ms), a prime (40 ms), and a backward mask (200 ms), repeated three times with the same prime. Neutral or happy primes, masks, and target faces were matched and derived from the same actor. A qRNG then determined whether a happy (‚Äú0‚Äù bit) or angry facial expression (‚Äú1‚Äù bit) was displayed as the target stimulus for 1000 ms. Each trial was followed by a black inter-trial interval (1200 ms).\nAfter all 40 trials, participants rated their perception of friendly faces as positive and angry faces as negative on a seven-point scale and indicated their overall feeling of success for the day.

It ran in full-screen mode using jsPsych, a JavaScript library for web-based behavioral experiments, on a dedicated university webserver. The Quantis tRNG for stimulus selection was connected to the server via USB.\nStimuli\nVisual stimuli were sourced from Shutterstock, selecting 100 positive and 100 negative images. Positive images included social scenes, landscapes, and cute animals, while negative images depicted danger, distress, and unpleasant scenes. The images were chosen by the authors based on their expertise in emotion induction.\nTo enhance emotional impact, audio stimuli were included. Positive and negative effects were conveyed through consonant and dissonant piano chords, respectively. From a set of eight consonant and eight dissonant chords, two of each type were selected for the study.",

They were instructed to find a quiet environment and tested for audio capability by identifying the content of a short audio clip. Upon successful audio test completion, they were redirected to the university‚Äôs webserver where the experiment ran in full-screen mode.\nParticipants first completed a 2-minute relaxation exercise designed to induce a relaxed and optimistic mood. This exercise was available in German, Italian, and Spanish, narrated by native speakers. The exercise encouraged slow, calm breathing and muscle relaxation to foster a sense of comfort and safety.\nAfter the relaxation exercise, participants were informed about the study and instructed that they would view pleasant and unpleasant images and hear corresponding sounds, with the option to abort by closing the window. The tRNG then randomly selected visual and auditory stimuli for 100 trials, each lasting about 6 minutes. During each trial, a fixation cross appeared for 700 ms, followed by the stimuli for 400 ms, and then a black screen for 1100 ms.\nAfter the trials, participants completed a questionnaire. They rated their belief in general contentedness and hopeful confidence on a seven-point scale. Stimulus seeking was assessed using a scale with two statements about boredom and enjoyment of rewatching movies, scored on a five-point scale (Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± = 0.59).\nParticipants also filled out a self-efficacy attitude measure regarding life outcome expectancies, rating six statements on a seven-point scale (Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± = 0.80). Finally, they completed the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), which assesses generalized optimism (Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± = 0.76) and pessimism (Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± = 0.73) with three items each.",

This method provides a more flexible and effective way to test hypotheses compared to frequentist methods. The stopping criterion for data collection was set at a BF of 10, indicating strong evidence for either the effect (H1) or the null effect (H0).\nIn Bayesian analysis, the BF quantifies the relative evidence for H1 versus H0. A BF10 = 10 suggests that H1 is ten times more likely than H0. The study used a Cauchy distribution (Œ¥ ‚àº Cauchy [0, r]) with an r value of 0.1 to account for typically small effect sizes in Psi research.\nData were analyzed using a Bayesian one-sample t-test with a one-tailed approach, comparing the mean score of positive stimuli presentations against chance (50%). These analyses were conducted weekly from November 2016 to July 2017 using the JASP software (Version 0.8.2).

An experimental program written by one of the experimenters in C# accesses the output of the QRNG and depicts a random picture out of two different picture sets depending on the result of the quantum experiment inside the QRNG.\nStimuli\nThe neutral stimulus pictures were taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999), which provides an experimental set of 1169 digitized photographs with normative rating scores (using a 9 point rating scale) on valence and arousal. A set of 10 neutral pictures (valence mean = 4.90; SD = 0.27) were used. The target stimulus pictures were taken from the Geneva Smoking Photographs (GSP) (Khazaal et al., 2012), a normative database providing 60 addiction-relevant photographs for nicotine and tobacco research. Again 10 pictures were chosen showing varying aspects of nicotine products, smoking behavior and tobacco related cues.\nQuantum State Generation\nA quantum based number generator (QRNG) was used to create the quantum experiment. This device creates a quantum state consisting of two eigenstates that correspond to the two possible states of a bit (0/1) that is transferred to the computer. A 0 bit lead to the display of a neutral image while a 1 bit lead to the display of a target stimuli. The QRNG device is connected to the laptop via USB. Since it is not operating with a buffer, it is ensured that the bit that decides which stimulus is shown is generated directly prior to the display of the picture.",

Since there is no physical interaction other than observing, participants were explicitly and repeatedly asked to maintain attention on the pictures for the whole time and to not become distracted. They were told they may interrupt the experiment at any time if they are not feeling well.\nParticipants then were presented with a total of 400 pictures. Each trial started with a fixation cross for 700 msecs followed by the stimulus for 400 msecs and a 400 msecs long inter-trial interval showing only a black screen. Depending on the outcome of the QRNG a random picture was chosen out of the pool of either the neutral stimuli or the tobacco-related target stimuli. Each picture of the two pools had the same probability to be shown in every trial.\nAfter completion of the 400 trials the experimenter prepared the laptop to show a digital questionnaire which asked whether the participant is a smoker or non-smoker. Additionally, with smokers the nicotine dependence was assessed via the Fagerstr√∂m Test for Nicotine Dependencies (FTND-G; German version by (John et al., 2003)) as well as the general attitude towards smoking. The experiment and the questionnaire took about 15-20 mins.",

Participants were instructed to ensure an undisturbed environment and provided basic demographic information before entering full-screen mode and receiving written task instructions. They were informed they would see flickering visual stimuli and positive and negative images that should be watched passively, and were reminded they could withdraw at any time.\nEach participant completed 40 trials, with every target pair being selected twice and shuffled into a unique order. A software randomizer then assigned 20 trials to the experimental condition (Creduced) and 20 to the control condition (Cmax). During each trial, a fixation cross appeared for 1200 ms to direct attention, followed by the subliminal priming sequence. The three prime presentations (50/50, 60/40, and 70/30 mixtures) were each displayed for 55 ms with forward and backward masks lasting 110 ms each, separated by 1000 ms black screens. After the priming procedure, the quantum random number generator determined whether the positive or negative target from the matched pair would be presented. Depending on the condition, this random selection was either stored to memory (Cmax) or added to a temporary counter (Creduced). The selected target appeared for 1000 ms, followed by a 1200 ms inter-trial interval.\nAfter 24 trials, participants clicked a continue button to confirm their alertness, with data excluded if they failed to respond within 10 seconds. Upon completing all 40 trials, participants viewed the actual number of positive images chosen by the quantum random number generator in each condition, displayed as ‚ÄúA‚Äù for the control condition and ‚ÄúB‚Äù for the experimental condition. No explicit instruction to memorize these numbers was given, creating an incidental learning task. Following a brief filler task involving luckiness ratings, participants completed a recall task where they attempted to remember the numbers previously shown after ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB.‚Äù\nThe design created three dependent variables: for the experimental condition (Creduced), only subjective memory data were available since the temporary counter was not saved to results files; for the control condition (Cmax), both subjective memory data and objective computer-stored data were retained, allowing comparison between objective reality and subjective recall across different levels of confirmation.",

    "text": "Procedure\nParticipants were invited by Kantar with the exclusion criterion being that participants had not previously taken part in experiments using this paradigm. Participants were instructed to ensure an undisturbed environment and provided basic demographic information before entering full-screen mode and receiving written task instructions. They were informed they would see flickering visual stimuli and positive and negative images that should be watched passively, and were reminded they could withdraw at any time.\nEach participant completed 40 trials, with every target pair being selected twice and shuffled into a unique order. A software randomizer then assigned 20 trials to the experimental condition (Creduced) and 20 to the control condition (Cmax). During each trial, a fixation cross appeared for 1200 ms to direct attention, followed by the subliminal priming sequence. The three prime presentations (50/50, 60/40, and 70/30 mixtures) were each displayed for 55 ms with forward and backward masks lasting 110 ms each, separated by 1000 ms black screens. After the priming procedure, the quantum random number generator determined whether the positive or negative target from the matched pair would be presented. Depending on the condition, this random selection was either stored to memory (Cmax) or added to a temporary counter (Creduced). The selected target appeared for 1000 ms, followed by a 1200 ms inter-trial interval.\nAfter 24 trials, participants clicked a continue button to confirm their alertness, with data excluded if they failed to respond within 10 seconds. Upon completing all 40 trials, participants viewed the actual number of positive images chosen by the quantum random number generator in each condition, displayed as ‚ÄúA‚Äù for the control condition and ‚ÄúB‚Äù for the experimental condition. No explicit instruction to memorize these numbers was given, creating an incidental learning task. Following a brief filler task involving luckiness ratings, participants completed a recall task where they attempted to remember the numbers previously shown after ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB.‚Äù\nThe design created three dependent variables: for the experimental condition (Creduced), only subjective memory data were available since the temporary counter was not saved to results files; for the control condition (Cmax), both subjective memory data and objective computer-stored data were retained, allowing comparison between objective reality and subjective recall across different levels of confirmation.",

    "text": "Sample Size and Data Analysis\nWe employed Bayesian inference statistics to test the hypothesis, which allow for sequential data accumulation until specific stopping criteria are met. For the correlation effect analysis, we used a Bayesian correlation test with a stopping rule of BF = 10 (indicating strong evidence for either the null or alternative hypothesis). If this criterion wasn‚Äôt reached by approximately 1,000 participants, data collection would continue if a clear trend toward BF10 = 10 was observable.\nThe correlation analysis used a Beta (0.1) prior distribution based on an estimated effect size of r = .1, which had been previously applied in analyzing the original faulty correlation data from Dechamps et al.¬†(2021). For standard micro-PK effects, we conducted separate one-sample Bayesian t-tests for experimental and control conditions using one-tailed approaches with informed priors centered around 0.05 (Œ¥ ~ Cauchy [0.05, 0.05]). Interestingly, we expected and hoped for null findings, as the absence of standard micro-PK effects was considered a precondition for the correlation effect to appear, consistent with their preregistration.\nThe Bayesian analyses were performed irregularly during data collection, approximately weekly for the first 1,000 participants and then again with the complete sample of over 2,000 participants, using R‚Äôs ‚ÄòBayes Factor‚Äô package. Data collection occurred between January and February 2021.\nRegarding sample size, although the stopping criterion of BF10 = 10 for the correlation effect was reached early at n = 24, we considered this subsample too small to provide convincing evidence and continued until reaching 1,000 participants. At this point, the correlation was r = .034 (similar to the original r = .032), but the Bayesian evidence remained inconclusive (BF10 = 0.42). Following the preregistration, we collected data from an additional 1,000 participants before stopping due to exhausted financial resources. The final sample included N = 2,052 participants.",

Crucially, the games were categorized in advance as either ‚Äúfun‚Äù or ‚Äúnot fun,‚Äù and participants‚Äô enjoyment, as well as their motivational states, were measured through various questionnaires. We were particularly interested in whether intrinsic aspects of motivation‚Äîsuch as self-regulation, vitality, and perceived autonomy‚Äîwould correlate with how many enjoyable games were presented by the QRNG, suggesting a non-random influence consistent with MPK.\nOur hypothesis was that individuals with higher intrinsic motivation, particularly in terms of their engagement, autonomy, and self-regulatory capacity, would exhibit an increased likelihood of being presented with games they found enjoyable. This would indicate an intentional construction of subjective reality interacting with objective quantum processes. We also explored whether these correlations varied by gender, given potential differences in gaming preferences and motivation structures.",

To test this, we designed a roulette game in which participants were assigned to either an experimental or a control group. In both groups, the participants placed bets on red or black. However, only in the experimental group did the outcomes from an additional 99 qRNGs (representing robot clones of the player) contribute to the total winnings shown to the participant. In the control group, these extra qRNGs were also run but their outcomes were hidden and irrelevant to the player‚Äôs reward. If a meaning-based connection as proposed by the unus mundus theory holds, only the qRNGs that were meaningful to the participant‚Äîthat is, those in the experimental group‚Äîshould be susceptible to induced correlations.\nWe hypothesized (H1) that both groups might show positive deviations from chance due to mind-matter interactions, but the experimental group would show a faster and stronger effect. Furthermore (H2), we expected that the experimental group would outperform the control group in total effect strength.

    "text": "Hypothesis\nThis experiment was developed by students in an empirical course. We set out to investigate whether hopeful, emotionally anchored intentions could influence objective reality‚Äîin this case, by improving performance in a simple online guessing game.\nWe hypothesized that a volitional impulse, grounded in an optimistic emotional conviction, could act as a bridge between subjective mental images and objective outcomes. Based on this, we designed an experiment in which participants were asked to guess whether a cat was hidden in a box, with a 50% chance of being correct each time. Before one of the two conditions, participants read a short text meant to induce hopeful, trusting intentions toward a benevolent higher power which served as experimental condition. The other condition served as a baseline and included no such manipulation.\nOur primary hypothesis (H1) stated that guessing accuracy would be higher in the hope condition than in the control condition. Additionally, we explored whether personal traits like optimism (H2) and subjective vitality (H3) would correlate positively with guessing performance, assuming that such traits might predispose individuals to form stronger or more effective positive intentions.",

    "text": "Materials\nIn this study, we used a range of psychological questionnaires and digital games as materials to assess participants‚Äô motivation and to examine potential micro-psychokinetic effects. The study was conducted online and designed to be completed on a computer. Participants began by answering demographic questions, followed by several instruments designed to measure motivational constructs:\n\nPrimary motivation question: Participants selected their main reason for taking part in the study from a set of predefined options.\nIntrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI): We adapted items from the pressure/tension and interest/enjoyment subscales to assess aspects of self-control and self-regulation in relation to the study and the games.\nSubjective Vitality Scales (SVS): A short questionnaire assessing participants‚Äô current energy and vitality.\nGame presentation and feedback: Participants were shown previews of various mini-games and asked to indicate which ones they expected to enjoy. However, the actual game selection was determined by a quantum random number generator (QRNG). After each game, participants rated their enjoyment on a 5-point scale (Appendix E).\nGame categories: We categorized ten games into two types:\n\n‚ÄúFun‚Äù games (e.g., Pinball, Pong, Boomshine, Tetris, Snake), chosen for their general enjoyability.\n‚ÄúNot fun‚Äù games, designed to strain short-term memory and include tasks like memorizing sequences or doing arithmetic problems.\n\nPost-game questionnaires:\n\nSelf-perceived autonomy (Janke & Gl√∂ckner-Rist, 2012)\nEgo depletion / Self-control capacity (SMS-5; Lindner et al., 2019)\nImplicit Theory of Willpower (Job et al., 2010)\n\n\nAll games were limited to two minutes or ended earlier if completed. Participants could play up to six games (including a trial game), with each subsequent game being randomly determined by the QRNG.",

    "text": "Procedure\nThe study was conducted online.\nFirst, participants were informed about the study‚Äôs goals, data protection, and their rights, and provided informed consent. They then completed a short demographic questionnaire, indicating their age, gender, and current occupation.\nNext, we assessed their initial motivation for participating in the study through a single-choice question. This was followed by a series of psychological questionnaires designed to measure various aspects of intrinsic motivation, including adapted subscales from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) that focused on pressure/tension (self-control) and interest/enjoyment (self-regulation), as well as the Subjective Vitality Scales (SVS) to capture their current sense of energy and vitality.\nFollowing this initial assessment, participants viewed image previews of ten mini-games ‚Äî five categorized as ‚Äúfun‚Äù (e.g., Tetris, Pong) and five as ‚Äúnot fun‚Äù due to their cognitive demands (e.g., memory tasks, arithmetic). Participants indicated which games they would prefer to play, though this had no influence on actual game presentation.\nEach participant then completed one trial game to familiarize themselves with the format. After that, the qRNG controlled the game sequence. After each game, the QRNG decided‚Äîwith a 50% probability‚Äîwhether another game would follow or the study would proceed to the final questionnaire phase. If another game was selected, the QRNG again determined with a 50% chance whether it would be a fun or not-fun game. The same game could be repeated. Participants played a maximum of six games, including the trial.\nAfter each game, participants rated how much fun they had on a 5-point Likert scale. Once the game phase ended (after the maximum number or when the QRNG selected to stop), participants were directed to the final set of questionnaires, assessing:\n\nPerceived autonomy during the study,\nSelf-control capacity / ego depletion (SMS-5),\nImplicit theory of willpower, exploring beliefs about mental stamina and recovery.",

After applying our pre-registered exclusion criteria‚Äîremoving those who did not complete the study or indicated they had not done so carefully‚Äîwe were left with a final sample of 285 participants.\nThe main dependent variable was ‚Äúguessing performance,‚Äù measured as the number of correct guesses in each condition. To test our main hypothesis (H1), we conducted a one-sided, dependent-samples t-test comparing performance in the hope condition to the control condition. Bayesian statistics were used for inference: the Bayes factor (BF+0 = 0.148) provided moderate evidence against our hypothesis. An additional analysis in the reverse direction yielded a Bayes factor of 3.19, suggesting moderate evidence that performance was actually better in the control condition.\nWe also explored correlations between guessing performance and personality traits such as optimism and vitality. However, no significant relationships were found, and the exploratory hypotheses (H2 and H3) were rejected. A small positive correlation between performance across the two conditions (r = .117) indicated some individual consistency in guessing ability, but this was not central to our main research questions.",

After providing informed consent and basic demographic information, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups that differed only in the order in which they completed the two conditions.\nIn each condition, participants encountered ten guessing trials. On each trial, they saw a closed box and had to decide whether or not it contained a cat, with a 50% probability of being correct. They were instructed to rely on their gut feeling for each decision. The correct answers were pre-determined by the computer.\nIn the experimental condition, participants first read a brief instructional text designed to evoke a sense of trust and optimism in a higher power. This was intended to induce emotionally anchored, hopeful intentions. They were encouraged to maintain this emotional state throughout the guessing task. In contrast, the control condition involved the same guessing task but without any priming text.\nAfter completing both conditions, participants filled out a series of short questionnaires measuring constructs such as optimism, pessimism, vitality, autonomy, willpower, and momentary self-control capacity. Finally, they were asked whether they had completed the study carefully, which served as a control measure for data validity.",
