An experimental program written by one of the experimenters in C# accesses the output of the QRNG and depicts a random picture out of two different picture sets depending on the result of the quantum experiment inside the QRNG.\nStimuli\nThe neutral stimulus pictures were taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999), which provides an experimental set of 1169 digitized photographs with normative rating scores (using a 9 point rating scale) on valence and arousal. A set of 10 neutral pictures (valence mean = 4.90; SD = 0.27) were used. The target stimulus pictures were taken from the Geneva Smoking Photographs (GSP) (Khazaal et al., 2012), a normative database providing 60 addiction-relevant photographs for nicotine and tobacco research. Again 10 pictures were chosen showing varying aspects of nicotine products, smoking behavior and tobacco related cues.\nQuantum State Generation\nA quantum based number generator (QRNG) was used to create the quantum experiment. This device creates a quantum state consisting of two eigenstates that correspond to the two possible states of a bit (0/1) that is transferred to the computer. A 0 bit lead to the display of a neutral image while a 1 bit lead to the display of a target stimuli. The QRNG device is connected to the laptop via USB. Since it is not operating with a buffer, it is ensured that the bit that decides which stimulus is shown is generated directly prior to the display of the picture.",

They were told they may interrupt the experiment at any time if they are not feeling well.\nParticipants then were presented with a total of 400 pictures. Each trial started with a fixation cross for 700 msecs followed by the stimulus for 400 msecs and a 400 msecs long inter-trial interval showing only a black screen. Depending on the outcome of the QRNG a random picture was chosen out of the pool of either the neutral stimuli or the tobacco-related target stimuli. Each picture of the two pools had the same probability to be shown in every trial.\nAfter completion of the 400 trials the experimenter prepared the laptop to show a digital questionnaire which asked whether the participant is a smoker or non-smoker. Additionally, with smokers the nicotine dependence was assessed via the Fagerstr√∂m Test for Nicotine Dependencies (FTND-G; German version by (John et al., 2003)) as well as the general attitude towards smoking. The experiment and the questionnaire took about 15-20 mins.",

During each trial, a fixation cross appeared for 700 ms, followed by the stimuli for 400 ms, and then a black screen for 1100 ms.\nAfter the trials, participants completed a questionnaire.

Stimulus seeking was assessed using a scale with two statements about boredom and enjoyment of rewatching movies, scored on a five-point scale (Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± = 0.59).\nParticipants also filled out a self-efficacy attitude measure regarding life outcome expectancies, rating six statements on a seven-point scale (Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± = 0.80).

Neutral or happy primes, masks, and target faces were matched and derived from the same actor. A qRNG then determined whether a happy (‚Äú0‚Äù bit) or angry facial expression (‚Äú1‚Äù bit) was displayed as the target stimulus for 1000 ms. Each trial was followed by a black inter-trial interval (1200 ms).\nAfter all 40 trials, participants rated their perception of friendly faces as positive and angry faces as negative on a seven-point scale and indicated their overall feeling of success for the day.

The division point was the standardized average value for healthy individuals as specified in the manual.\nMeasured variables\n\nAttachment: Target stimuli consisted of 20 pictures of happy couples, sourced from Shutterstock, aimed at addressing the need for attachment. Neutral stimuli, sourced from the OASIS picture set (Kurdi et al., 2016), included 20 pictures of everyday objects rated low on arousal and neutral in valence. The outcome variable for attachment was the number of displayed target stimuli.\nSelf-esteem: The target stimuli included negatively perceived adjectives that challenge self-esteem (e.g., ‚Äúugly,‚Äù ‚Äúworthless,‚Äù ‚Äústupid‚Äù), corresponding to dimensions in the ‚ÄúFeelings of Inadequacy Scale‚Äù (Janis & Field, 1959). Neutral stimuli included adjectives describing geometric figures and surface textures (e.g., ‚Äúfive-cornered,‚Äù ‚Äúdotted‚Äù). The outcome variable for self-esteem was the number of displayed target stimuli.\nControl: To test the need for orientation and control, participants were shown unpleasant pictures from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999), which have a negative valence and high arousal. In control trials, participants could end the display by pressing a button, whereas in non-control trials, the display lasted 2500 ms regardless of button press. 75% of the trials allowed for control over the presentation time.

    "text": "Hypothesis\nThe research hypotheses of the study focus on testing the validity of a micropsychokinetic (micro-PK) effect, which refers to the idea that the mind can subconsciously influence random events, such as the viewing of erotic images. The study builds on previous work by Maier and Dechamps, who suggested that a micro-PK effect might manifest as a decrease in effect strength over time, following a pattern similar to a damped harmonic oscillation (a gradually diminishing wave-like pattern). The hypotheses are as follows:\n\nThe micro-PK effect will decrease over time during data collection.\nThe micro-PK effect will follow a systematic pattern similar to a damped harmonic oscillation, which would require a large sample size to observe.\nIf a micro-PK effect is present, the frequency of increases and decreases in the effect will be higher when analyzed sequentially compared to simulated data, indicating a true micro-PK effect.\n\nThe experiment focuses on the influence of micro-PK effects triggered by the unconscious desires of individuals addicted to pornography when viewing erotic images. The study assumes that the unconscious need for explicit material (independent variable) might influence the results of a true random number generator (tRNG), leading to a higher probability of selecting images that match the observer‚Äôs unconscious needs.\nFinally, the study predicts that for pornography addicts, the tRNG will generate fewer erotic images than expected by chance, forming the basis for applying the previous three hypotheses:\n\nWhen observed by a subject addicted to pornography, the number of erotic images shown will be statistically significantly below the chance level.",

Attitudes towards pornography were measured using a nine-item scale, and participants‚Äô pornography usage behavior was also recorded. Control variables included honesty, attention to the images, and how erotic the images were perceived to be.\nThe experimental phase involved participants viewing a series of 50 randomly generated images, either erotic or neutral, determined by a quantum random number generator. The experiment was conducted online, with participants instructed to focus on the images while maintaining attention throughout. The images were displayed briefly, followed by a black screen, and this process was repeated 50 times. The study aimed to measure the number of erotic images viewed as the dependent variable.\nThe stimuli used in the experiment included neutral images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and erotic images from both IAPS and the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS). Due to a lack of suitable erotic images, particularly homosexual ones, additional images were sourced from license-free databases and validated by experts. Participants could choose image sets based on their sexual orientation, ensuring that the erotic content was relevant to their preferences.",

Before conducting the study, it was decided to use Bayesian one-sided one-sample t-tests for data analysis.\nFor the Bayesian analysis, the effect size was defined a priori using a Cauchy distribution, with a scale parameter (r) of .1, based on previous research by the LMU Micro-Pk lab. This choice of a lower r value is typical in psi research, where effect sizes are generally small.\nTo determine if the effect followed a damped harmonic oscillation, a regression analysis was conducted using the Python module SciPy. Specifically, the scipy.optimize.curve_fit function was employed, which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to estimate the parameters of the damped harmonic oscillation based on the principle of the sum of least squares. This method allowed the researchers to assess whether the data exhibited the predicted oscillatory pattern.\nThe sample size was determined by practical restrictions, since this study was conducted as a student project with limited resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Report\nExperimental Program\nQuestionnaire\nStimuli Sources",

The qRNG first selected a random image 1 out of 10, then a fixation cross was shown before the qRNG selected a random bit 0 or 1 determining whether the image should be shown out of the win or loss set. This way, 10 sets of 20 trials each with short breaks in between were presented to the participants. For each block with more than 50% hits they received a candy (Smartie) for each additional hit (e.g.¬†12 hits = 2 smarties).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreregistration\nStimulus material\nQuestionnaire\nStudent report",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis section will be updated with each new release of the report. Current state: 04 May 2020\n\n\n\nSummary of Results\nThe meta-analytic assessment of all micro-PK experiments conducted at the LMU Micro-PK lab currently encompasses 14 studies with a total of 23 experimental conditions and 13 control conditions, including data from 55668 participants and reveals several key insights. Although individual studies included in this report often tested specific hypotheses, the meta-analysis focused on a general micro-PK effect to ensure comparability. Descriptions of the hypotheses for each study can be found in the respective experiments section.\nThe overall effect size for micro-PK was found to be non-significant (0.017, p = 0.155) across experimental conditions, with moderate heterogeneity (45.34%). Similarly, control conditions showed no significant effect (-0.005, p = 0.646). These results suggest that the experimental manipulations may not be robust enough to produce a consistently meaningful effect. The moderate heterogeneity in both analyses indicates variability due to study design or implementation differences, though the lack of significant heterogeneity in control conditions suggests that variability in experimental conditions is more likely due to differences in interventions.\n\n\nChange of Evidence Measures\nSince Psi-effects may be influenced by the accumulation of evidence over time, new measures have been devised to analyze how this evidence changes. By comparing these results to simulations, empirical p-values can be calculated. A meta-analytic assessment of these change-of-evidence measures was conducted using the inverse chi-square invchisq-function to combine p-values across studies. Three characteristics were analyzed: Maximum Bayes Factor (BF), BF Energy, and the amplitude sum of the BF curve‚Äôs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\nFor all experimental conditions, the combined chi-square statistics were calculated with 35571 degrees of freedom, yielding the following results: 36155.12 for the Maximum BF (p = 0.015), 36096.14 for the BF Energy (p = 0.025) and 36174.83 for the FFT amplitude sum (p = 0.012).\nThe analysis of change of evidence measures demonstrated statistically significant results for experimental conditions, suggesting that observed evidence changes are unlikely due to random variation. This could be the result of a volatile micro-PK effect. In contrast, none of the three characteristics demonstrated statistically significant results for the control conditions. However, these significant results in experimental conditions do not necessarily translate into a substantial overall effect, as no significant effect was found in the aggregate meta-analysis of micro-PK interventions. They do, however, indicate that the observed changes in evidence are not likely due to random variation.\n\n\nAddressing Publication Bias\nA potential concern in meta-analyses is publication bias, where significant results are more likely to be published compared to non-significant findings. In our case, the comprehensive inclusion of both published and unpublished studies from our research group effectively mitigates this concern. By incorporating all relevant studies, our analysis is less susceptible to selective reporting, enhancing the reliability of our findings.\n\n\nImplications of Findings\nThe significant change of evidence measures in experimental conditions suggest dynamic factors influencing evidence accumulation. According to the Model of Pragmatic Information, novel, autonomous effects may decrease in detectability over time. This model may explain the observed volatility and highlights the potential of change of evidence measures for understanding temporal dynamics in micro-PK effects.\nDespite these insights, the non-significant overall effect size indicates that micro-PK interventions, as tested, may not consistently produce a robust effect. Future research should focus on refining experimental designs, replicating studies, and exploring the underlying mechanisms of micro-PK effects to establish more consistent evidence.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile our meta-analysis at this point in time did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect of micro-PK interventions, the significant change of evidence measures in experimental conditions indicate that the phenomena observed are not purely due to chance. Future research should focus on refining experimental designs, conducting replication studies, and maintaining transparent reporting practices to further explore and validate micro-PK effects. Addressing these aspects will help in understanding the underlying mechanisms and improving the robustness of evidence in this field.\nWe would like to additionally encourage the scientific community to follow this example of transparent reporting and data sharing to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of research findings in the field of parapsychology and related disciplines and to counteract publication bias and selective reporting practices.",

    "text": "Empirical research on Micro-Pk often times reports a decline of initially present effects (Colborn, 2018). This phenomenon can be explained either by an initial false positive followed naturally by a regression to the true mean. Alternatively, it fits the predictions of the Model of Pragmatic Information, which states that novel, autonomous effects are inversely linked to their confirmation or detectability (Lucadou et al., 2007). This would result in a decrease of effect size over time, since accumulated data means more power and possibility of convincing confirmatory results (Maier et al., 2022).\nRecently, efforts have been made to find ways to methodically distinguish false positives from decline effects using so called change of evidence-measures (Dechamps, 2019). These measures work by analyzing the temporal development of Bayesian evidence for the effect over the course of data collection and compare certain characteristics to a set of simulations representing possible an empirical null distribution.",

    "section": "Bayesian Analysis",
    "text": "Bayesian Analysis\nIn Bayesian statistics, test results often times are reported as Bayes Factors (BF). A BF characterizes the relative evidence for two hypotheses, e.g.¬†the presence of an effect versus the absence of an effect. A BF of 1 indicates equal evidence for both hypotheses, a BF &gt; 1 indicates evidence for the presence of an effect (H1), and a BF &lt; 1 indicates evidence for the absence of an effect (H0). A BF is symmetrical around 1, meaning that a BF of 0.5 indicates the same evidence for H0 as a BF of 2 indicates for H1. Similar to the convetion of using a p-value of 0.05 as a threshold for significance, a BF can be classified into different categories of evidence strength, whereas a BF &gt; 3 is considered moderate evidence, and a BF &gt; 10 is considered strong evidence (Jeffreys, 1961)\n\\[ BF = \\frac{P(D|H1)}{P(D|H0)} \\]\nAn advantage of Bayesian testing is that it allows for the continuous updating of evidence as new data comes in. In contrast to using p-values, there is no need for an a priori power analysis. Instead a desired level of evidence can be set, and the data collection can be stopped as soon as this level is reached. Even then, data can be added to further substantiate the evidence without the risk of inflating error rates, since the BF is consistent over time.\nThe possibility of monitoring the change of evidence over time is especially useful in the context of Micro-Pk research, where an effect volatility could be assumed. If this was the case, the BF would not be consistent, but dependent on the level of confirmatory power. This would result in unusual patterns of evidence change, which could be detected by comparing the empirical BF to a set of simulated BFs as is done with the following change of evidence-measures.",

    "text": "Simulations\nThe change of evidence measures are based on a set of Monte-Carlo simulations. These simulations are based on the same data generating process as the empirical data, but with the effect size set to 0. This means that the simulations represent the null hypothesis, and the BFs calculated from these simulations represent the empirical null distribution. The empirical BF is then compared to this distribution to detect unusual patterns of evidence change.\nThe simulations used for the analysis of this lab report are generated with true random numbers using the same qRNG as most of the studies. This ensures that the simulations are based on the same random process as the empirical data. The number of simulations is set to 1000, which is a common number in the literature.",

It is calculated as the integral of the BF in relation to the BF=1 line. Areas above the BF=1 line are positive, areas below are negative. The energy of the BF is a measure of the overall evidence for the presence of an effect at any point in time.\nExample:\n\nplotbf(bf)+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(x=1:length(bf$BF), ymin = pmin(bf$BF, 1), ymax = 1), fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(x=1:length(bf$BF), ymin = 1, ymax = pmax(bf$BF, 1)), fill = \"green\", alpha = 0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: The green area indicates the positive energy (bf directed towards H1), the red area the negative energy (bf directed towards H0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nres &lt;- energybf(bf, sims)\n\n&gt;&gt; BF ENERGY &lt;&lt; \nCalculating Energy of sims... \n\n Energy of BF of data:  564.2794 \nSims Energy: M = -19.24502 , SD = 224.5401 \nSims with this or higher Energy: 1.9 % \n\n\n\n\nFrequency Analysis\nThe Frequency Analysis provides a measure of the pronouncedness of oscillatory patterns in the BF curve. If an effect is countered by a decline effect the BF curve will oscillate between and increase and decrease of evidence. This measure is calculated by specifying the Fast Fourier transforms of the experimental and simulated BF curves and adding up all amplitude values. A sampling rate of 1 over the number of data points is used and only the first half of the fft is considered, since it is symmetrical.\nExample:\n\nplotfft(fftcreate(bf), sims)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: The Fast Fourier Transform of the Bayes Factor curve.

A micro-Pk effect should result in a (temporary; see change of evidence) biasing of the qRNG outcome corresponding to the presentation of more or less of the relevant stimuli.\n\n\nOnline Studies\nIf an experiment is classified as an online study, it was set up with the software jsPsych (Leeuw et al., 2023) and running on a dedicated web server in the departments IT infrastructure. A qRNG is directly connected to the web server via USB and provides random events without a buffer.\n\n\nProcedural Details\nPlease refer to the experimental programs attached to the resources of each study for all procedural details, like stimulus presentation timings, questionnaires, etc.",

Six hypotheses were developed to test this phenomenon, comparing the number of erotic images seen by different participant groups against random chance using Bayesian one-sample t-tests.\nHypothesis 1 predicted that individuals who frequently consume pornography and have a positive, healthy relationship with it would see more erotic images than expected by chance, as their subconscious desire would influence the outcome.\nHypotheses 2 and 3 focused on singles: satisfied singles were expected to see more erotic images due to their contentment, while dissatisfied singles were predicted to see fewer images because of their perceived lack or deprivation, drawing on findings from a similar study involving nicotine-dependent smokers.\nHypotheses 4 and 5 mirrored this logic for people in relationships: satisfied individuals were expected to see more erotic images, while dissatisfied individuals were predicted to see fewer, again due to perceived lack.\nHypothesis 6 extended this reasoning to individuals addicted to internet pornography, suggesting that they would see fewer erotic images due to their addiction, which creates a constant sense of deprivation. This hypothesis was particularly influenced by the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the subconscious state of deprivation leads to fewer instances of the desired outcome, as seen in similar studies on addiction.",

Participants were also asked about their pornography consumption habits, including type, duration, and frequency.\nTo assess pornography addiction, the Cyber Pornography Use Inventory (CPUI) was used.

The study was conducted in German, with a majority of participants being native German speakers.\nErotic images were used to test for micro-psychokinetic effects, with four sets of stimuli created. These included neutral images and erotic images tailored to different sexual orientations: heterosexual, lesbian, and gay. The neutral and heterosexual erotic images were sourced from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), while the lesbian and gay erotic images were obtained from license-free websites and validated by individuals of each sexual orientation to ensure appropriateness and normative quality.muli, examining how the priming affected the likelihood of selecting positive or negative target images.",

The link to the study was shared in diverse groups, including those focused on psychological topics, as well as groups related to different sexual orientations.\nParticipants first answered demographic questions and completed part of the Cyber Pornography Use Inventory (CPUI) to assess their addiction to internet pornography. They also responded to questions about their pornography consumption habits and general attitudes toward pornography. Following this, participants were shown 50 images that matched their sexual orientation, which included either erotic content or neutral stimuli like everyday objects. After viewing the images, participants answered post-task questions to assess how seriously they had taken the study and the truthfulness of their responses. These answers were used to exclude any participants who might have provided dishonest or inattentive responses, ensuring the validity of the study‚Äôs findings. Finally, two questions related to self-efficacy were included, although they were not central to the research question and were intended for use in a different study.",

The experimental program was executed on a dedicated webserver based at the university and displayed via participants‚Äô web browsers, implemented using jsPsych, a JavaScript library designed for online behavioral experiments.\nStimuli: Positive and negative pictures served as target stimuli, with a mixture of these as prime stimuli. The target stimuli were sourced from Shutterstock and included 20 positive photographs (depicting pets, peaceful landscapes, and happy people) and 20 negative photographs (depicting dangerous or attacking animals and other negative scenarios). These images were selected based on valence estimations by two experts in experimental emotion induction techniques. Each positive image was paired with a similar negative image to create matched pairs (e.g., a friendly dog vs.¬†an aggressive dog). To balance color differences, all images were converted to black-and-white.\nTwo classes of priming stimuli were created: neutral (control) and positive (experimental). Neutral primes were constructed by overlaying two matched target pictures (50/50 blend), resulting in 20 neutral primes. These primes were accompanied by forward and backward masks, created by scrambling the prime image into blocks to destroy meaningful content. Positive priming involved the same matched target pairs, but with a progressive increase in the positive image share (50/50, then 60/40, then 70/30) to make the positive picture more dominant in the participant‚Äôs unconscious mind.\nPriming Procedure: Each trial included presenting a subliminal prime followed by a target picture. Each priming stimulus was shown three times before the target display, and the target picture was randomly selected by a quantum random number generator (qRNG) from the pair used to create the prime. The assignment of neutral or positive priming to a trial was performed by a pseudo-random number generator (pRNG).\nThis experimental setup aimed to test the influence of unconscious priming on participants‚Äô perception of positive or negative stimuli, examining how the priming affected the likelihood of selecting positive or negative target images.",

The dependent variables were the mean number of positive pictures and the number of 0 bits generated by the qRNG in both priming conditions.\nAfter the task, participants completed a questionnaire assessing stimulus-seeking behavior, self-efficacy attitude related to general life outcomes, and generalized optimism and pessimism using the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R). These measures were exploratory, with no specific hypotheses, and results will be reported in a future publication.",

    "text": "Sample Size and Data Analysis\nThe study employed a Bayesian approach, which allows for data accumulation until a specific stopping criterion is met. The stopping rule was defined as a Bayes Factor (BF) of 10, indicating strong evidence for either the null hypothesis (H0) or the alternative hypothesis (H1). For the analyses in Study 1, an uninformed prior following a Cauchy distribution centered around 0 with an r = 0.1 was chosen, based on an estimated effect size of Cohen‚Äôs d = 0.1, which has been previously applied in similar research. The prediction was that there would be more positive stimuli than expected by chance in the experimental condition, with a smaller effect in the control condition. Two separate one-sample Bayesian t-tests with a one-tailed approach were used for the analyses, performed regularly (almost weekly) with updated sample means. The statistical software JASP (Version 0.9) was used for these analyses. Data collection occurred from March to July 2018.\nAlthough the stopping criterion of BF10 = 10 was reached multiple times during data collection, it went unnoticed due to the large volume of data points added weekly. As a result, data collection continued until the criterion was securely met, which occurred at N = 4,092 participants. Demographic data were available for 4,034 participants. Data collection was then stopped according to Bayesian rules of analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication (Dechamps et al., 2021)\nOSF Project\nAnalyses\nExperimental Program\nStimuli",

The QRNG, producing random states via photon deflection, ensured true quantum randomness for each trial. The QRNG passed stringent randomness tests and did not use post-correction procedures.\nAssessment of Personality Traits\nCluster C PTs were measured using the VDS-30 questionnaire, taking around ten minutes to complete. It includes ten items per PT, rated on a four-point scale, and has good internal consistency (Œ± = .72 to Œ± = .86) and retest reliability (r = .70 to r = .83). Scores were divided into high scorers (target group) and low scorers (control group) based on a mean cut-off (‚â• 1.00).\nStimuli\nFor each PT, five target stimuli were created based on VDS-30 items, aimed at triggering doubts in individuals with respective PTs. Five neutral control sentences were also selected. An online pre-study rated these sentences on valence, correlating ratings with VDS-30 scores. Initial data collection involved 73 participants rating 60 sentences in randomized order, with filler sentences to avoid negative mood shifts. Adequate trait-specific correlations were found for DE-PT and AV-PT targets, with additional sentences created as needed. However, OC-PT targets initially showed poor specificity, leading to a second pre-study with 34 participants. Four OC-PT target sentences were identified, with one additional sentence created based on validated stimuli.",

An experimental program written by one of the experimenters in C# accesses the output of the QRNG and depicts a random picture out of two different picture sets depending on the result of the quantum experiment inside the QRNG.\nStimuli\nThe neutral stimulus pictures were taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999), which provides an experimental set of 1169 digitized photographs with normative rating scores (using a 9 point rating scale) on valence and arousal. A set of 10 neutral pictures (valence mean = 4.90; SD = 0.27) were used. The target stimulus pictures were taken from the Geneva Smoking Photographs (GSP) (Khazaal et al., 2012), a normative database providing 60 addiction-relevant photographs for nicotine and tobacco research. Again 10 pictures were chosen showing varying aspects of nicotine products, smoking behavior and tobacco related cues.\nQuantum State Generation\nA quantum based number generator (QRNG) was used to create the quantum experiment. This device creates a quantum state consisting of two eigenstates that correspond to the two possible states of a bit (0/1) that is transferred to the computer. A 0 bit lead to the display of a neutral image while a 1 bit lead to the display of a target stimuli. The QRNG device is connected to the laptop via USB. Since it is not operating with a buffer, it is ensured that the bit that decides which stimulus is shown is generated directly prior to the display of the picture.",

They were told they may interrupt the experiment at any time if they are not feeling well.\nParticipants then were presented with a total of 400 pictures. Each trial started with a fixation cross for 700 msecs followed by the stimulus for 400 msecs and a 400 msecs long inter-trial interval showing only a black screen. Depending on the outcome of the QRNG a random picture was chosen out of the pool of either the neutral stimuli or the tobacco-related target stimuli. Each picture of the two pools had the same probability to be shown in every trial.\nAfter completion of the 400 trials the experimenter prepared the laptop to show a digital questionnaire which asked whether the participant is a smoker or non-smoker. Additionally, with smokers the nicotine dependence was assessed via the Fagerstr√∂m Test for Nicotine Dependencies (FTND-G; German version by (John et al., 2003)) as well as the general attitude towards smoking.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the actual cumulative z-score to that of 10,000 simulations and predicted a closer match than 5% of simulations for the following test statistics:\n\nThe area between the experimental data curve and the prediction.\nThe Euclidian distance of the local maximum compared with that of the prediction.\nThe Euclidian distance of the end point compared with that of the end point of the prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication (Dechamps & Maier, 2019)\nPreregistration\nOSF Project",
