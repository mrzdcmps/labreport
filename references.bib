abstract={The Persuasibility Test scores of 96 female high school Ss were significantly higher than those of 86 male high school Ss. No significant relationship found between Otis IQ and Persuasibility Test scores for either sex. No significant correlations between Persuasibility Test scores and any of 9 self-rating personality clusters for the female Ss. Male Ss had low but significant correlations between Persuasibility test scores and self-ratings on feelings of social inadequacy, social inhibitions, richness of fantasy, and argumentativeness. Self-ratings on test anxiety, suspiciousness, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and neurotic anxiety symptoms were not significantly correlated with Persuasibily Test scores for either sex.
