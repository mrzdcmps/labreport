## Overview

```{r}
st <- readRDS("overview.rds")

library(formattable)
formattable(format(st, digits=2, nsmall = 2, scientific=F),
            align = c("l",rep("c", NCOL(st) - 1)),
            list(`Hits (%)` = color_tile("coral2","cornflowerblue"),
                 `Experimental condition` = formatter("span", 
                                   x ~ icontext(ifelse(x == F, "remove", "ok")), 
                                   style = x ~ style(color = ifelse(x == F, "red", "green"))),
                 `p` = formatter("span",
                                     style = x ~ style("font-weight" = ifelse(x <= 0.05, "bold", NA))),
                 `Labstudy` = formatter("span", 
                                   x ~ icontext(ifelse(x == F, "globe", "home")),

## Description of Experiments

### General Information

#### Generation of Randomness

When not specified otherwise, we used a quantum-based random number generator (qRNG) *Quantis* by idquantique to generate true randomness and coupled the outcome of these random events to the display of relevant stimulus material. A micro-Pk effect should result in a (temporary; see [*change of evidence*](changeofevidence.html)) biasing of the qRNG outcome corresponding to the presentation of more or less of the relevant stimuli.

#### Online Studies

If an experiment is classified as an online study, it was set up with the software jsPsych [@deleeuw2023] and running on a dedicated web server in the departments IT infrastructure. A qRNG is directly connected to the web server via USB and provides random events without a buffer.

### Loving Kind

#### Hypothesis

Participants underwent a pre-recorded "loving kindness"-meditation. At the end of the hypnosis they were asked to listen to sounds that were either classified *neutral* (white noise) or *meditation-related* (singing bowl; mantra). We hypothesized an increase of meditation-related sounds ("hits").

### Prayer

#### Hypothesis

Participants were asked to pray to enter a state of devotion. Subsequently they were presented a combination of either positive images and sounds or negative images and sounds. We hypothesized more positive stimuli ("hits").
