## General Information

### Generation of Randomness

When not specified otherwise, we used a quantum-based random number generator (qRNG) *Quantis* by idquantique to generate true randomness and coupled the outcome of these random events to the display of relevant stimulus material. A micro-Pk effect should result in a (temporary; see [*change of evidence*](changeofevidence.html)) biasing of the qRNG outcome corresponding to the presentation of more or less of the relevant stimuli.

### Online Studies

If an experiment is classified as an online study, it was set up with the software jsPsych [@deleeuw2023] and running on a dedicated web server in the departments IT infrastructure. A qRNG is directly connected to the web server via USB and provides random events without a buffer.
